# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 adds **Security Behavior Analysis** capabilities to the correlation engine, enabling historical tracking, pattern detection, and risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Schema (SQLAlchemy Models)
**Files**: `app/models/__init__.py`, `app/database.py`

#### Tables Created:
1. **Scans** - Records each security scan with metadata
   - Commit hash, branch, author, timestamp
   - Scanner versions (Semgrep, CodeQL, ZAP)
   - Summary statistics (total findings, severity counts)

2. **Vulnerabilities** - Tracks individual vulnerabilities over time
   - Unique fingerprint for cross-scan tracking
   - Location (file, line), type, severity, confidence
   - Lifecycle state (NEW, EXISTING, FIXED, REGRESSED, IGNORED)
   - Timestamps (first_seen, last_seen, fixed_at)
   - Risk metrics (risk_score, age_days, pattern_frequency)
   - Git context (introduced_commit, fixed_commit)

3. **VulnerabilityStateHistory** - Audit trail of state transitions
   - Tracks all state changes with timestamps
   - Records reason for change
   - Links to scan and commit

4. **CodeChanges** - Tracks file modifications between scans
   - Change type (added, modified, deleted, renamed)
   - Lines added/deleted
   - Complexity delta
   - Author and commit info

5. **SecurityPatterns** - Identified patterns and anti-patterns
   - Pattern name, category, description
   - Detection rules
   - Occurrence statistics
   - Affected files
   - Remediation guidance

6. **SecurityMetrics** - Historical metrics for trend analysis
   - Vulnerability counts by severity
   - Lifecycle metrics (new, fixed, regressed)
   - Time-to-fix statistics
   - Code churn metrics
   - Risk score aggregates

**Database CLI**:
- `python -m app.main db init` - Create all tables
- `python -m app.main db reset` - Drop and recreate
- `python -m app.main db status` - Show database info

---

### 2. Git History Analyzer
**File**: `app/core/git_analyzer.py`

**Capabilities**:
- **Commit Analysis**: Retrieve current commit, commit history, file-specific history
- **Blame Tracking**: Identify which commit introduced specific lines of code
- **Change Detection**: Track files modified between commits with stats
- **Security Keyword Analysis**: Detect security-related commits (fix, patch, vulnerability, CVE)
- **Code Churn Calculation**: Measure how frequently files change
- **Vulnerability Fingerprinting**: Generate stable IDs for tracking (SHA-256 of file:line:type)

**Key Methods**:
```python
analyzer = GitHistoryAnalyzer(repo_path)
analyzer.get_current_commit()  # Current commit info
analyzer.get_commit_history(max_count=50)  # Recent commits
analyzer.find_when_line_introduced(file, line)  # Git blame
analyzer.get_file_changes_between_commits(from, to)  # Diff
analyzer.analyze_commit_for_security_keywords(hash)  # Security analysis
GitHistoryAnalyzer.generate_vulnerability_fingerprint(file, line, type)  # Fingerprint
```

**Example Usage**:
```python
analyzer = GitHistoryAnalyzer('..')
current = analyzer.get_current_commit()
# Output: {'hash': '814ba2c2...', 'author': 'Srinidhi', 'date': ...}

fp = analyzer.generate_vulnerability_fingerprint(
    'vulnerable-app/src/.../UserController.java',
    35,
    'SQL Injection'
)
# Output: 'f624f42b98f1fc9b...' (64-char fingerprint)
```

### 3. Vulnerability Lifecycle Tracker
**File**: `app/services/behavior/lifecycle_tracker.py`

**Purpose**: Track vulnerabilities across multiple scans to identify lifecycle state changes.

**States**:
- **NEW**: First time detected
- **EXISTING**: Detected in multiple scans (persistent)
- **FIXED**: No longer detected (resolved)
- **REGRESSED**: Was fixed but reappeared
- **IGNORED**: Marked as false positive or accepted risk

**Key Features**:
- **Fingerprint Matching**: Uses SHA-256 fingerprints to track vulnerabilities across scans
- **Automatic State Transitions**: Detects new, fixed, and regressed vulnerabilities
- **Git Integration**: Records which commits introduced/fixed vulnerabilities
- **History Tracking**: Maintains complete audit trail of state changes
- **Metrics Calculation**: Computes mean time to fix (MTTF)

**API**:
```python
tracker = VulnerabilityLifecycleTracker(db_session, git_analyzer)

result = tracker.process_scan_results(
    scan_id=1,
    findings=correlated_findings,
    commit_hash='abc123'
)
# Returns: {'new': [...], 'existing': [...], 'fixed': [...], 'regressed': [...]}

mttf = tracker.calculate_mean_time_to_fix()
# Returns: 12.5 (average days to fix)

history = tracker.get_vulnerability_history(fingerprint)
# Returns complete timeline of vulnerability
```

**Lifecycle Logic**:
1. **First Scan**: All findings marked as NEW
2. **Subsequent Scans**:
   - Found again → NEW becomes EXISTING
   - Not found → EXISTING/NEW becomes FIXED
   - Found after FIXED → becomes REGRESSED
3. **State History**: Every transition recorded with timestamp, reason, commit

### 4. Risk Scoring Algorithm
**File**: `app/services/behavior/risk_scorer.py`

**Formula**:
```
Risk Score (0-10) = 
  Severity × 0.30 +
  Exploitability × 0.25 +
  Age × 0.15 +
  Frequency × 0.15 +
  Blast Radius × 0.10 +
  Fix Difficulty × 0.05
```

**Scoring Components**:

| Factor | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Severity** | 0-10 | Critical=10, High=8, Medium=5, Low=2.5, Info=1 |
| **Exploitability** | 0-10 | Based on confidence score + state multipliers |
| **Age** | 0-10 | 0-7 days=4, 7-30=6, 30-90=8, 90+=10 |
| **Frequency** | 0-10 | Pattern occurrence count (5+=9, 3+=7, 2+=5, 1=3) |
| **Blast Radius** | 0-10 | Impact type (SQL injection, RCE=high) × endpoints affected |
| **Fix Difficulty** | 0-10 | Complex types (IDOR, crypto) + code complexity |

**Risk Categories**:
- **Critical**: 8.5 - 10.0
- **High**: 7.0 - 8.49
- **Medium**: 4.0 - 6.99
- **Low**: 0.0 - 3.99

**API**:
```python
scorer = RiskScorer()

risk_score = scorer.calculate_risk_score(
    vulnerability,
    context={
        'pattern_frequency': 3,
        'affected_endpoints': 5,
        'code_complexity': 12
    }
)
# Returns: 7.85

category = scorer.get_risk_category(risk_score)
# Returns: "High"

explanation = scorer.explain_risk_score(vulnerability, context)
# Returns detailed breakdown of all components
```

**Special Cases**:
- **Regressed vulnerabilities**: 1.5x exploitability multiplier (serious!)
- **High-impact types**: SQL injection, command injection, auth bypass get higher blast radius
- **Complex fixes**: IDOR, crypto, deserialization get higher difficulty scores

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Vulnerability Fingerprinting
**Why SHA-256 of file:line:type?**
- Stable across scans (same vuln = same fingerprint)
- Handles code changes (line number changes = new fingerprint = intentional)
- Prevents false matches (includes type to distinguish co-located issues)

### 2. State Machine Design
**Why 5 states instead of just fixed/open?**
- **NEW**: Helps identify recent introductions
- **EXISTING**: Tracks persistence (important for MTTF)
- **REGRESSED**: Critical state indicating process failures
- **IGNORED**: Prevents false positives from cluttering metrics
- **FIXED**: Clear resolution tracking

### 3. Weighted Risk Scoring
**Why these specific weights?**
- **Severity (30%)**: Most important - industry standard criticality
- **Exploitability (25%)**: Second most - confirmed vulnerabilities are urgent
- **Age (15%)**: Persistent issues indicate systemic problems
- **Frequency (15%)**: Repeated patterns suggest architectural flaws
- **Blast Radius (10%)**: Impact matters but is often hard to quantify
- **Fix Difficulty (5%)**: Least important - shouldn't defer critical fixes

### 4. SQLite for Development
**Why not PostgreSQL from the start?**
- Faster development iteration (no server setup)
- Easier testing and reset
- Production can easily switch via `DATABASE_URL` env var
- SQLAlchemy abstracts database differences

## Integration Points

### How Phase 2 Connects to Phase 1:

```python
# Phase 1: Correlation
correlator = SecurityCorrelator()
correlated_findings = correlator.correlate()

# Phase 2: Behavior Tracking
with get_db() as db:
    # Create scan record
    scan = Scan(
        commit_hash=git_analyzer.get_current_commit()['hash'],
        total_findings=len(all_findings),
        correlated_count=len(correlated_findings)
    )
    db.add(scan)
    db.commit()
    
    # Track lifecycle
    tracker = VulnerabilityLifecycleTracker(db, git_analyzer)
    result = tracker.process_scan_results(
        scan.id,
        correlated_findings,
        scan.commit_hash
    )
    
    # Calculate risk scores
    scorer = RiskScorer()
    for vuln in result['new'] + result['existing']:
        vuln.risk_score = scorer.calculate_risk_score(vuln)
    
    db.commit()
```
